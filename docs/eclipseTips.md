Eclipse Tips
============

Workspace Auto Refresh
----------------------

Setting `General > Workspace` checking `Refresh automatically` will have Eclipse automatically pick up the changes after you run code generation each time. Otherwise you'll have to manually tell Eclipse to refresh after running code generation.

Static Import Favorites
-----------------------

If you list `MigrationKeywords` in your Eclipse favorites setting, their static methods will show up in `Ctrl-Space` code completion:

`Java > Editor > Content Assist > Favorites` add:

    joist.migrations.MigrationKeywords

Now in migrations, typing `cr<Ctrl-Space>` will have `createTable` show up.

Static Import `*`
-----------------

Static import support is still kind of clunky in Eclipse, e.g. copy/pasting code that uses static imports from one class to another will not bring the static imports with it, creating compile errors that are annoying to resolve.

Setting `Java > Code Style > Organize Imports > Number of static imports needed for *` to `1` means that `MigrationKeywords.*` will be used as soon as you have a single static import keyword in use and makes the copy/paste experience nicer.

Lombok (http://projectlombok.org/)
-----------------------
Lombok needs to be installed in your eclipse instance. After ivy has downloaded the jars, navigate to IVY_CACHE/org.projectlombox/lombok/jars. Execute:
java -jar lombok.jar
This brings up an installer wizard. Select your eclipse installation. This will add the lombok jar to eclipse so that eclipse can compile code with lombok annotations.
